arraylist linkedlist using zero length arrays tips developed using java sdk standard edition v issue jdc tech tips written glen mccluskey using arraylist linkedlist arraylist linkedlist two collections classes used storing lists object references example could arraylist strings linkedlist integers tip compares performance arraylist linkedlist offers suggestions classes right choice given situation first key point arraylist backed primitive object array arraylist much faster linkedlist random access accessing arbitrary list elements using get method note get method implemented linkedlists requires sequential scan front back list scan slow linkedlist fast way access nth element list consider following example suppose large list sorted elements either arraylist linkedlist suppose binary search list standard binary search algorithm starts checking search key value middle list middle value high upper half list eliminated however middle value low lower half list ignored process continues key found list lower bound search becomes greater upper bound program binary search elements arraylist linkedlist import java util public class listdemo static final int n static list values make list increasing integer values static integer vals new integer n random rn new random int currval lt n vals new integer currval currval rn nextint values arrays aslist vals iterate across list look every value list using binary search static long timelist list lst long start system currenttimemillis int lt n look value list using binary search int indx collections binarysearch lst values get sanity check result binary search indx system println quot error n quot return system currenttimemillis start public static void main string args lookups arraylist system println quot time arraylist quot timelist new arraylist values lookups linkedlist system println quot time linkedlist quot timelist new linkedlist values listdemo program sets list sorted integer values adds values arraylist linkedlist collections binarysearch used search value list run program see result looks something like time arraylist time linkedlist arraylist times faster linkedlist results might differ depending machine characteristics see distinct difference result arraylist compared linkedlist true programs tip clearly linkedlist bad choice situation binary search algorithm inherently uses random access linkedlist support fast random access time random access linkedlist proportional size list comparison random access arraylist fixed time use randomaccess marker interface check whether list supports fast random access void f list lst lst instanceof randomaccess supports fast random access arraylist implements randomaccess interface linkedlist note collections binarysearch take advantage randomaccess property optimize searches results prove arraylist always better choice necessarily many cases linkedlist better also note many situations algorithm implemented efficiently linkedlist example reversing linkedlist using collections reverse internal algorithm gets reasonable performance using forward backward iterators let look another example suppose list elements lot element inserting deleting list case linkedlist better choice demonstrate consider following quot worst case quot scenario demo program repeatedly inserts elements beginning list code looks like import java util public class listdemo static final int n time long takes add n objects list static long timelist list lst long start system currenttimemillis object obj new object int lt n lst add obj return system currenttimemillis start public static void main string args timing arraylist system println quot time arraylist quot timelist new arraylist timing linkedlist system println quot time linkedlist quot timelist new linkedlist run program result look something like time arraylist time linkedlist results pretty much reverse previous example element added beginning arraylist existing elements must pushed back means lot expensive data movement copying contrast adding element beginning linkedlist simply means allocating internal record element adjusting couple links adding beginning linkedlist fixed cost adding beginning arraylist cost proportional list size far tip looked speed issues space let look internal details arraylist linkedlist implemented java sdk standard edition v details part external specification classes illustrative classes work internally linkedlist class private internal class defined like private static class entry object element entry next entry previous entry object references list element along next previous elements linkedlist words doubly linked list linkedlist elements entry objects linked together referencing actual list elements significant space overhead linkedlist structure given entry objects arraylist backing object array store elements array starts capacity array needs grow new capacity computed newcapacity oldcapacity notice array capacity grows time means arraylist large number elements significant amount space wasted end waste intrinsic way arraylist works spare capacity array would reallocated new element performance would suffer dramatically changing growth strategy aggressive doubling size reallocation would result slightly better performance would waste space know many elements arraylist specify capacity constructor also call trimtosize method fact reallocate internal array gets rid wasted space far discussion assumed either arraylist linkedlist quot right quot given application sometimes choices make sense example consider common situation list key value pairs would like retrieve value given key could store pairs n x object array find right pair could sequential search key values approach works useful choice small lists say elements less doesn scale big lists another approach sort key value pairs ascending key value store result pair arraylists binary search keys list approach also works fast yet another approach use list structure instead use map structure hash table form hashmap faster binary search arraylist hashmap final example compares two import java util public class listdemo static final int n lists keys values static list keys static list values fill keys list ascending order key values fill values list corresponding values key static integer keyvec new integer n integer valuevec new integer n random rn new random int currval lt n keyvec new integer currval valuevec new integer currval currval rn nextint keys arrays aslist keyvec values arrays aslist valuevec fill map key value pairs static map map new hashmap static int lt n map put keys get values get binary search lookup keys static long timelist long start system currenttimemillis int lt n int indx collections binarysearch keys keys get sanity check returned value binary search indx system println quot error n quot return system currenttimemillis start map lookup keys static long timemap long start system currenttimemillis int lt n integer value integer map get keys get sanity check value returned map lookup value values get system println quot error n quot return system currenttimemillis start public static void main string args timing list implementation system println list time timelist timing map implementation system println quot map time quot timemap program sets lists keys values uses two different techniques map keys values one approach uses binary search list hash table run listdemo program get result looks something like arraylist time hashmap time example n value approximately log n comparisons required average successful binary search binary search lookup arraylist take comparisons contrast properly implemented hash table typically requires comparisons expect hash table faster case however binary search still useful example might want lookup sorted list find keys close value key used lookup easy binary search impossible hash table keys hash table stored apparent random order also concerned worst case performance binary search algorithm offers much stronger performance guarantee hash table scheme might also consider using treemap lookups sorted collections key value pairs let summarize key points presented tip appending elements end list fixed averaged cost arraylist linkedlist arraylist appending typically involves setting internal array location element reference occasionally results array reallocated linkedlist cost uniform involves allocating internal entry object inserting deleting elements middle arraylist implies rest list must moved inserting deleting elements middle linkedlist fixed cost linkedlist support efficient random access arraylist space overhead form reserve capacity end list linkedlist significant space overhead per element sometimes map structure better choice list information using arraylist linkedlists see section list section map sortedmap quot java tm programming language third edition

filtering often eliminate values input could optimize away second input scan adding code like int outdata new int validcnt validcnt return outdata note usage int outdata new int also legal initialize
